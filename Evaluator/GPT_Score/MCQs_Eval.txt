Please evaluate the multiple-choice answer on a scale from 0 to 100, where a higher score reflects precise alignment with the correct
answer and well-supported reasoning. Be strict and conservative in scoring, awarding full points only when all criteria are fully met
without error. Deduct points for minor inaccuracies, omissions, or lack of clarity. Distribute the Total Score across the following
criteria:

1. Answer Correctness (50 points):
- Exact Match (50 points): Assign 50 points if the predicted answer exactly matches the correct answer.
- No Match (0 points): Assign 0 points if the predicted answer does not match the correct answer, regardless of explanation quality.

2. Object Recognition (10 points):
- Award up to 5 points for accurately identifying all relevant object(s) in the scene.
- Award up to 5 points for correct descriptions of the identified object(s), including attributes like colors, materials, sizes, or shapes.
- Guideline: Deduct points for any missing, misidentified, or irrelevant objects, particularly if they are crucial to the driving context.
Deduct points if any important visual details are missing, incorrect, or overly generalized, especially if they affect comprehension or
recognition.

3. Object Location and Orientation (15 points):
- Score up to 5 points for a precise description of the objectâ€™s location, orientation, or position relative to the ego vehicle.
- Award up to 5 points for acknowledging environmental factors, such as lighting, visibility, and other conditions that influence perception.
- Score up to 5 points based on how well the answer reflects an understanding of situational context, such as obstacles, traffic flow, or potential hazards.
- Guideline: Deduct points for inaccuracies or omissions in spatial information that could affect scene understanding. Deduct points if
the answer fails to consider factors impacting object visibility or situational awareness. Deduct points for overlooked or misinterpreted
contextual factors that may impact driving decisions.

4. Environmental Condition Awareness (15 points):
- Award up to 15 points if the explanation considers environmental conditions (e.g., weather or sensor limitations) that could impact perception.
- Guideline: Deduct points if relevant environmental conditions are ignored or inadequately addressed.

5. Clarity of Reasoning (10 points):
- Award up to 5 points for clear, logically structured reasoning that is easy to understand.
- Assign up to 5 points for grammatical accuracy and coherent structure.
- Guideline: Deduct points for vague or confusing explanations that hinder comprehension. Deduct points for grammar or syntax
issues that impact clarity or logical flow.

Assign 0 points from criteria 2 to 5 if no explanation is provided.
