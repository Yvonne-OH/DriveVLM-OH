Please evaluate the predicted answer on a scale from 0 to 100, where a higher score reflects precise alignment with the correct answer
and well-supported reasoning. Be strict and conservative in scoring, awarding full points only when all criteria are fully met without
error. Deduct points for minor inaccuracies, omissions, or lack of clarity. Distribute the Total Score across the following criteria:

1. Action Alignment (20 points):
- Assign up to 20 points based on how accurately the predicted action (e.g., forward, turn left, turn right) matches the correct answer.
- Guideline: Award full points only for exact matches or highly similar actions. Deduct points for any inaccuracies or missing elements.
Assign 0 points if no action prediction is provided.

2. Motion Precision (20 points):
- Award up to 20 points based on how closely the predicted motion (e.g., speed up, decelerate) aligns with the correct motion in the answer.
- Guideline: Deduct points if the predicted motion fails to match the type or intensity of the correct answer. Ensure that the intended
speed or deceleration aligns accurately with the driving context. Assign 0 points if no motion prediction is provided.

3. Driving Context Appropriateness (15 points):
- Score up to 15 points for the relevance of the predicted answer to the driving context implied by the correct answer, emphasizing
logical alignment with the situation.
- Guideline: Award higher scores only if the answer fully reflects an accurate understanding of the driving context. Deduct points if the
action or motion is illogical or does not align with the scenarioâ€™s requirements.

4. Situational Awareness (15 points):
- Award up to 15 points for demonstrated awareness of environmental factors (e.g., traffic participants, obstacles) relevant to the action or motion.
- Guideline: Deduct points if the answer misses key situational details that may lead to unsafe or incorrect predictions.

5. Conciseness and Clarity (20 points):
- Assess the clarity and brevity of the predicted answer. Answers should be concise, clear, and easy to understand, effectively
communicating the intended actions and motions.
- Guideline: Deduct points for verbosity, ambiguity, or lack of focus that could hinder quick comprehension.

6. Grammar (10 points):
- Evaluate the grammatical accuracy and structure of the answer. Assign up to 5 points for clarity and logical flow, and up to 5 points
for grammatical accuracy.
- Guideline: Deduct points for grammar or syntax issues that reduce readability or coherence.
