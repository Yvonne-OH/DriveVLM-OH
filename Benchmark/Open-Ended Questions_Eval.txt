Please evaluate the answer on a scale from 0 to 100, where a higher score reflects precise alignment with the correct
answer and well-supported reasoning.

Please strictly enforce the rules, scrutinize the grading rules, and give grades objectively!

1. Answer Correctness (40 points)
Assess how well the respondent's answer aligns with the standard answer in terms of key elements and overall completeness.
Score Ranges:
Perfect Alignment (40 points): The response perfectly matches the standard answer with complete accuracy in all key elements.
Minor Discrepancies (30-39 points): The answer is largely accurate but contains slight deviations that do not significantly alter the overall correctness or relevance.
Moderate Discrepancies (11-29 points): The response includes some errors. These errors do not compromise safety or critical aspects but show a misunderstanding or partial knowledge.
Major Discrepancies (0-10 points): The answer has significant errors that could impact safety or contravene established regulations, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the required knowledge or procedures.

2. Reasoning Validity (40 points)
Assess the logic and rationale behind the respondent's answer.
Note: If the standard answer does not include reasoning, assign the same score as given for Answer Correctness to ensure consistency.
Score Ranges:
Sound, well-explained reasoning: 40 points
Slightly illogical or incomplete reasoning: 30-39 points
Moderately illogical or lacks significant details: 11-29 points
Severely flawed or no apparent logical foundation: 0-10 points

3. Clarity of Reasoning (20 points)
This category evaluates the grammar, conciseness, and fluency of the response,
focusing solely on the way the answer is presented rather than its correctness.
Score Ranges:
Clear, concise, and grammatically correct: 20 points
Minor issues with clarity or minor grammatical errors: 15-19 points
Moderate clarity issues or several grammatical errors: 10-14 points
Poor clarity, overly verbose, or numerous grammatical errors: 0-9 points
